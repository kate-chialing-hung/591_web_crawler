## Potential Optimization
- Change the way of getting content: 
  * Current method: simulate browser behavior with `selenium` and parse `html` (powerful but time & memory consuming)
  * Potential fix: send requests directly and parse response `json` directly
- Computation resource: 
  * Current method: sequentially scan all pages, needs to wait in line
  * Potential fix: use parallel computation to get more timely results
